# N-Mark Spade Panel

**Overview**

A web app recreation of the "N-Mark Spade Panel" (a.k.a. Matching Cards) minigame from Super Mario Bros. 3, meant to resemble it as close as possible.

**Development**

This project is javascript based and uses canvas to render the game. It leverages the game loop with the browser event loop. It is a minimal implementation that recreates the original game with added support for mouse and touchscreen.

**Setup**

To play the game you can download the repository and run it locally opening the index.html file on your browser.
